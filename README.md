# Java_EE-Login_App
Developed a Login web-app which validates your username and password from a MySQL Database and redirects accordingly

* The web-app is developed using Servlets, JavaServerPages (JSP), Javascript, CSS3, BootStrap.
* It validates the username and password entered against a mySQL database to check if the credentials exist in the database. If exists, it will redirect you to the 'Success' page, otherwise to the 'Failure' page.
* If the 'username' & 'password' fields are left empty, Javascript will prompt the user by displaying an error message.
* The SQL script to create a database and add dummy values has been provided in the project.
